# Singapore Bot
The goal of this project is to develop a preprocessing approach and train a neural network to classify images from Google Streetview as either from Singapore or not from Singapore.

## Usage
To evaluate model performance and test yourself classifying the images, use human_classify.py. To use this script, you must have the model.h5 file in the same directory, as well as the folder with images called "images_for_testing". These files can be downloaded here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c7-Cyx3KpsD_mnw8O-deUIzlLov3j9_j?usp=share_link
